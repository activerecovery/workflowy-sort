# workflowy-sort
This userscript can be used with TamperMonkey to sort Workflowy lists alphabetically on hotkey press (default hotkey is Ctrl+Shift+S).
I have not yet figured out how to save changes for all bullets (looking into it), so any bullet traversal or page reload will require you to reqpply the sort.
