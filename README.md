# workflowy-sort
This userscript can be used with TamperMonkey to sort Workflowy lists alphabetically.
By default, the script will sort any visible lists any time a bullet is clicked, or expanded, or if any of the hierarchy nav links at the top are clicked.
The script also provides sort on hotkey press (default is Ctrl+Shift+S). 
I have not yet figured out how to save changes for all bullets (looking into it), so all sorting is only provided in the client side view.
